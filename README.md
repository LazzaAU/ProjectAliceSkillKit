# Alice Skill Kit

The Alice Skill Kit is a tool that helps creating Modules for Alice.

## Features
- [create a new Module](https://github.com/project-alice-powered-by-snips/ProjectAliceSkillKit/blob/master/CreateModules.md)
- [validate the format of all json files](https://github.com/project-alice-powered-by-snips/ProjectAliceSkillKit/blob/master/Validation.md)

## Install
```bash
pip3 install alice-sk
```
The Skill Kit supports tab completion for `bash` and `zsh` it can be activated by adding this in your .bashrc:
```bash
eval "$(_ALICE_SK_COMPLETE=source alice-sk)"
```
For zsh users add this to your .zshrc:
```bash
eval "$(_ALICE_SK_COMPLETE=source_zsh alice-sk)"
```

## Testing
It is possible to run all validation tests we currently run against a module when someone submits a PR locally using:
```bash
alice-sk validate --path <pathnames>
```
Further information on the validation tests can be found [here](https://github.com/project-alice-powered-by-snips/ProjectAliceSkillKit/blob/master/Validation.md)


## Auto modules creation
To create the basic files needed for a module to work run:
```bash
alice-sk create
```
This saves you the hassle of creating the directory tree, the required files and so on. It also follows the strict conventions we made for modules and will avoid you trouble when submitting your module for review.
